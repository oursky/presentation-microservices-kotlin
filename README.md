## Introduction

Presented at GDG Kotlin/Everywhere Hong Kong : A Day of Kotlin, 31st Aug 2019

Two backend services are created in this project, `auth` and `app` respectively. A microservice-based architecture can be achieved locally with docker-compose. We have also deployed them on Oursky's k8s cluster.


## Get Started
##### Generate secret
```
cd backend
make secret
```
##### Start servers
```
cd backend
docker-compose -p demo up
```
##### Testing api call
```
curl http://localhost:8080/auth/ping
curl http://localhost:8080/app/ping
curl -X POST http://localhost:8080/auth/signup -H "Content-Type: application/json" -d '{"user": "test", "pass": "1234"}'
curl -X POST http://localhost:8080/auth/login -H "Content-Type: application/json" -d '{"user": "test", "pass": "1234"}'

# NOTE: replace with access token from signup/login response
curl -vvv http://localhost:8080/app/ping2 -H "Authorization: Bearer ACCESS_TOKEN"
```
